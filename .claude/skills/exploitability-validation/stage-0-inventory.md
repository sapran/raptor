# [STAGE-0] Inventory

You are building a ground truth checklist for coverage verification.

## Context

See `SKILL.md` for configuration, execution rules, and MUST-GATEs.

## Purpose

Create a comprehensive inventory of all code that needs to be analyzed. This becomes the source of truth for GATE-5 (FULL-COVERAGE) compliance.

## Task

DO:
1. Enumerate all files in codebase
2. Exclude test and mock files (patterns: `*_test.*`, `*_mock.*`, `test_*`, `mock_*`, `__tests__/`, `tests/`, `fixtures/`)
3. Extract all functions/methods per file
4. Output checklist.json

## Output Format

```json
{
  "generated_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "total_files": N,
  "total_functions": N,
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "relative/path/to/file.py",
      "language": "python",
      "functions": [
        {
          "name": "function_name",
          "line_start": 10,
          "line_end": 25,
          "checked": false
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output

OUTPUT: `checklist.json`

## Validation

Before completing, verify:
- [ ] All source files enumerated (not just sampled)
- [ ] Test/mock files explicitly excluded
- [ ] Each file has functions extracted
- [ ] JSON is valid and parseable
