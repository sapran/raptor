"""
Type hints for GitHub Forensics Evidence Schema.

These types are for static type checking and IDE autocomplete ONLY.
Do NOT instantiate these classes directly - use EvidenceFactory.

Usage (type hints only):
    from src.types import CommitObservation, IssueObservation

    def process_commit(commit: CommitObservation) -> None:
        print(commit.sha)

To create instances, use:
    from src import EvidenceFactory
    factory = EvidenceFactory()
    commit = factory.commit("owner", "repo", "sha")

WARNING: Importing from this module does NOT grant instantiation privileges.
The classes here are re-exported for type annotations only.
